##Homework

Write code using readFileSync() to count the number of new line characters in a given file. The user should supply the file name as an argument when running the script. For example:

Given the following test.txt file:

    hello
    blah blah
    goodbye

Running node newLineCount.js test.txt should print out 2.

Rewrite the above code using readFile()

Use the HTTP module to make a request to "http://omdbapi.com/?i=tt0241527" and store the data in an array. Once the first request is finished, make another request to "http://omdbapi.com/?i=tt0295297" and add the data to the same array. When the second request is finished, console.log the array with the data. Callbacks!!!
